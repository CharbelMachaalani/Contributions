This review highlights the molecular heterogeneity of gliomas across age groups and argues for age-spanning diagnostic and therapeutic strategies—particularly for adolescents and young adults—to bridge gaps created by pediatric–adult classification and care models.

In this review, I contributed directly to the writing and editing of the manuscript, focusing on all aspects related to WHO grade 1/2 tumors, as well as figure generation and design.
